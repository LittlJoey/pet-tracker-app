## üöÄ Get Started

1.  **Install dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Set up Supabase**

    This project requires a Supabase backend.
    - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com), create a project.
    - Use the `supabase_schema.sql` file in the root directory to set up your database tables.
    - Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Supabase URL and Anon Key:
      ```
      EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
      EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
      ```
    - Update the Supabase client initialization in `lib/supabase.ts` if you are not using `.env` files.

3.  **Start the app**

    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a:

-   [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
-   [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
-   [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
-   [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory.
